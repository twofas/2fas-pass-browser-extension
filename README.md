# 2FAS Pass Browser Extension
2FAS Pass Browser Extension seamlessly integrates with your mobile app to provide secure access to your passwords directly in your browser.

The extension respects your Security Tiers settings - allowing some passwords to be securely stored for a limited time, others to require confirmation on your mobile device, and some to never reach the browser extension at all, depending on your configuration.
# What is 2FAS Pass?
2FAS Pass is a local-first, next-generation password manager that puts you in full control of your data. Your passwords and sensitive information are stored on your device, and you decide how and where to synchronize them.

2FAS Pass is designed with privacy and user control at its core. You have full control over:
* **Data storage** - by default, everything stays on your device
* **Synchronization options** - securely sync using your own iCloud or Google Drive with end-to-end encryption (E2EE), your NAS (like QNAP or Synology), other devices, or even your custom cloud via WebDAV
* **Item Permissions** - our Security Tiers system lets you decide how each Item behaves: whether it can be shared with the Browser Extension or if it requires confirmation on your mobile device

The seamless integration between mobile app and browser extension ensures you have secure access to your Items and passwords across all your devices while maintaining full control over your data.
